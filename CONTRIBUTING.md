4. **Specific** steps to reproduce
5. MavensMate logs. Configure logging via MavensMate-app settings, run your failing operation to generate logs, and paste relevant logs to your issue.
6. If relevant, your Salesforce server (e.g., cs18, c31, na7, etc.)

If any of the above are missing, we will be unable to properly diagnose your issue.
