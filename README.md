## Update: August 7, 2017

[MavensMate is no longer available for download and is not being actively developed or supported](http://mavensmate.com/). We recommend using Salesforce's [official Visual Studio Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) for building Salesforce applications.


## Update: July 31, 2019 
Meanwhile updating the application so that it doesn't auto kill itself.
